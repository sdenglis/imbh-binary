# imbh-binary

Modeling Sag. A* binary, time-evolved IMBH system with CDM halo. We're using N-body simulation software, various semi-analytic (Eddington's formula, CBE w/ collision operator, etc.) approaches in order to properly encapsulate the energy injection of the gravitational waves emitted from such a merger event into the dark matter halo surrounding the system. Exploring questions of BH binary stability/efficacy & DM annihilation.
